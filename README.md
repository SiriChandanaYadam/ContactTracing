Contact tracing is a monitoring process including contact identification, listing, and follow-up, which is a key to slowing down pandemics of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.
Once a person is positive for coronavirus, it is very important to identify other people who may have been infected by the patients diagnosed. 
To identify infected people, the authorities follow the activity of patients diagnosed in the last 14 days. This process is called contact tracking.
Depending on the country and the local authority, the search for contacts is carried out either by manual methods or by numerical methods.
We can achieve this using Machine Learning models such as DBSCAN and scatter plots.
DBSCAN is a density-based data clustering algorithm that groups data points in a given space. The DBSCAN algorithm groups data points close to each other and marks outlier data points as noise.
